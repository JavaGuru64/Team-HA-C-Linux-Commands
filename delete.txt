Documentation for delete.c

WHAT IS THIS:

delete.c is the code for a program that deletes a file off of at the file system and can actually does the job of both rm and rmdir. 

INCLUDED C LIBRARIES:

# Libraries used for standard C functions and file manipulation #

stdlib.h
stdio.h

# Libraries used for easy yet in-depth error messages #

string.h
errno.h

FUNCTIONS:

void print_error(char *this, char *filename):

This function is passed in a string which is the name of the program running and a string which is the second argument passed through the command line. This function will then print out an error message based off of the current value in errno, which is a variable defined in errno.h, and then exits the program. This function is called whenever an error occurs in our program.

void print_usage(char *this):

This function is passed in a string which is the name of the program running. This function will then print out an error message and the proper usage of the program being run. This function will then exit the program. This error is run whenever the command line input does not make sense.

int main(int argc, char *argv[]):

Our main function. This takes in the command line arguments and removes this file or directory specified by the second argument passed through the command line. this is done using the remove(const char *filename) function which is declared in stdio.h. If there are not two command line arguments the syntax does not make sense and the print_usage(char *this) function is called.


ODDITIES:

Can delete both files and directories and is very limited (no special hyphen letter thingies like -rf for the rm Linux command)

DISCLAIMER:

To non-Linux people rm -rf can wipe your entire hard drive. To ALL if you must use this command I am in no way responsible for the results.
