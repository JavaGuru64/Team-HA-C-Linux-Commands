These eight files are simplified C implementations of some common Linux commands.These commands and their corresponding C implementations are listed below.

change_dir.c	implementation of	cd
concat.c	implementation of	cat 
copy.c		implementation of	cp
delete.c	implementation of	rm
list.c		implementation of	ls 
make_dir.c	implementation of	mkdir
make_file.c	implementation of	No corresponding linux command
move.c		implementation of	mv

There are some oddities in this list such as change_dir.c and make_file.c, but how and why they are oddities is covered in each corresponding text file. i.e. change_dir.c's corresponding text file is change_dir.txt.

Many, many thanks to GNU for their manual at:

This site is a wealth of information and I highly encourage anyone learning gcc C to read it.
