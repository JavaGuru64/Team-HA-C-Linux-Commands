Documentation for concat.c

WHAT IS THIS:

concat.c is the code for a program that prints the contents of a file to stdout and is my implementation for the cat Linux command. 

INCLUDED C LIBRARIES:

# Libraries used for standard C functions and file manipulation #

stdlib.h
stdio.h

# Libraries used for easy yet in-depth error messages #

string.h
errno.h

FUNCTIONS:

void print_error(char *this, char *filename):

This function is passed in a string which is the name of the program running and a string which is the second argument passed through the command line. This function will then print out an error message based off of the current value in errno, which is a variable defined in errno.h, and then exits the program. This function is called whenever an error occurs in our program.

void print_usage(char *this):

This function is passed in a string which is the name of the program running. This function will then print out an error message and the proper usage of the program being run. This function will then exit the program. This error is run whenever the command line input does not make sense.

int main(int argc, char *argv[]):

Our main function. This takes in the command line arguments and displays the file specified. If there is a filename given, then we open this file and print each line of the file to stdout. Otherwise the syntax does not make sense and we call the print_usage(char *this) function.

ODDITIES:

Limited to printing all lines from one file to stdout.
